0 But in prison he moot dwelle alway.
0 But seen his lady shal he never-mo.
0 For I wol telle forth as I bigan.
0 For seen his lady shal he never-mo.
0 That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.
0 That lene he wex, and drye as is a shaft.

0 And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.

2 Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.
2 And justify the ways of God to men.
2 For one restraint, lords of the World besides.
2 Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
2 Who durst defy th’ Omnipotent to arms.
2 Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.
2 The dismal situation waste and wild.
2 With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.
2 As from the centre thrice to th’ utmost pole.
2 Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!
2 “If thou beest he—but O how fallen!
2 What though the field be lost?
2 And what is else not to be overcome?
2 Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.
2 Here swallowed up in endless misery.
2 Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?
2 To undergo eternal punishment?
2 His inmost counsels from their destined aim.
2 To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
2 Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
2 If not, what resolution from despair.
2 Created hugest that swim th’ ocean-stream.
2 Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.
2 Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.
2 In billows, leave i’ th’ midst a horrid vale.
2 Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.
2 That we must change for Heaven?
2 A mind not to be changed by place or time.
2 Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.
2 Whom thunder hath made greater?
2 Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
2 Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?
2 Which, but th’ Omnipotent, none could have foiled!
2 No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!
2 Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.
2 Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.
2 Under amazement of their hideous change.
2 To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?
2 Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
2 Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!
2 Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
2 Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.
2 By their rebellion from the Books of Life.
2 And various idols through the heathen world.
2 While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
2 And with their darkness durst affront his light.
2 And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.
2 To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
2 Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
2 And works of love or enmity fulfil.
2 And Accaron and Gaza’s frontier bounds.
2 Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
2 Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.
2 With lust and violence the house of God?
2 Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
2 Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.
2 And o’er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.
2 Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.
2 Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.
2 From mortal or immortal minds.
2 Their painful steps o’er the burnt soil.
2 With all his peers: attention held them mute.
2 “O myriads of immortal Spirits!
2 Matchless, but with th’ Almighty!
2 As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
2 Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?
2 Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
2 By force hath overcome but half his foe.
2 Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.
2 Open or understood, must be resolved.
2 Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.
2 And hands innumerable, scarce perform.
2 Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.
2 To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.
2 Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.
2 With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.
2 Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings.
2 In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.
2 At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
2 And summons read, the great consult began.
2 “Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!
2 And trust themselves to fear no second fate!
2 That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.
2 “My sentence is for open war.
2 Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.
2 With upright wing against a higher foe!
2 In this abhorred deep to utter woe!
2 We should be quite abolished, and expire.
2 Than miserable to have eternal being!
2 Which, if not victory, is yet revenge.
2 Belial, in act more graceful and humane.
2 For dignity composed, and high exploit.
2 Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
2 Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
2 Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?
2 His red right hand to plague us?
2 Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
2 Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
2 The sentence of their Conqueror.
2 Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.
2 If we procure not to ourselves more woe.
2 To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.
2 Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.
2 Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!
2 Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?
2 In emulation opposite to Heaven.
2 Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.
2 What sit we then projecting peace and war?
2 In doing what we most in suffering feel?
2 That shook Heaven’s whole circumference confirmed.
2 The weight of all, and our last hope, relies.
2 And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.
2 Barred over us, prohibit all egress.
2 Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.
2 Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?
2 Which he through hazard huge must earn.
2 Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.
2 Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.
2 Or close ambition varnished o’er with zeal.
2 Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.
2 That day and night for his destruction wait!
2 With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.
2 With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.
2 The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.
2 From either end of heaven the welkin burns.
2 Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
2 (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?
2 And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
2 Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!
2 With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
2 Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
2 Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
2 Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of fire.
2 Periods of time,—thence hurried back to fire.
2 Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.
2 Up to the fiery concave towering high.
2 On either side a formidable Shape.
2 The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
2 With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.
2 That be assured, without leave asked of thee.
2 Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven.
2 To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
2 Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.
2 To join their dark encounter in mid-air.
2 Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.
2 His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!
2 Me father, and that phantasm call’st my son.
2 Sight more detestable than him and thee.
2 Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
2 From all her caves, and back resounded Death!
2 That rest or intermission none I find.
2 Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.
2 Save he who reigns above, none can resist.
2 Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey.
2 Fearless to be o’ermatched by living might.
2 Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?
2 Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.
2 Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.
2 Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.
2 Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.
2 And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.
2 And Discord with a thousand various mouths.
2 Erect the standard there of ancient Night.
2 Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge!
2 Made head against Heaven’s King, though overthrown.
2 To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!
2 Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain.
2 Charybdis, and by th’ other whirlpool steered.
2 God and good Angels guard by special grace.
2 Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.
2 Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.
2 Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
2 Whose fountain who shall tell?
2 Won from the void and formless infinite.
2 And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
2 Of things invisible to mortal sight.
2 Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.
2 Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.
2 He and his faithless progeny: Whose fault?
2 Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
2 Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
2 what praise could they receive?
2 Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.
2 Their freedom: they themselves ordain’d their fall.
2 But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.
2 Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d.
2 Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.
2 Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.
2 Of all things made, and judgest only right.
2 For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?
2 Be question’d and blasphem’d without defence.
2 To whom the great Creator thus replied.
2 Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.
2 All his deliverance, and to none but me.
2 To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
2 Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
2 And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.
2 And none but such from mercy I exclude.
2 The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
2 Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?
2 Man’s mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?
2 Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?
2 The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
2 His dearest mediation thus renew’d.
2 Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought?
2 Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.
2 My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.
2 Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.
2 By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.
2 The head of all mankind, though Adam’s son.
2 As many as are restored, without thee none.
2 His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.
2 In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
2 Man’s nature, lessen or degrade thine own.
2 In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.
2 Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.
2 Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.
2 With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.
2 Adore the Son, and honour him as me.
2 Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.
2 Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.
2 Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
2 Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.
2 Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.
2 Love no where to be found less than Divine!
2 Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men!
2 Forget, nor from thy Father’s praise disjoin.
2 Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
2 Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
2 Betwixt the angelical and human kind.
2 White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.
2 Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.
2 By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.
2 And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.
2 Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.
2 To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.
2 At sight of all this world beheld so fair.
2 So wonderously was set his station bright.
2 Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.
2 Drained through a limbeck to his native form.
2 Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?
2 He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
2 His journey’s end and our beginning woe.
2 Before his decent steps a silver wand.
2 O’er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.
2 To serve him better: Wise are all his ways.
2 In his uprightness, answer thus returned.
2 That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?
2 The rest in circuit walls this universe.
2 And in her pale dominion checks the night.
2 Adam’s abode; those lofty shades, his bower.
2 Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.
2 Nor staid, till on Niphates’ top he lights.
2 Woe to the inhabitants on earth!
2 Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
2 Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.
2 Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
2 Or from without, to all temptations armed.
2 Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
2 But Heaven’s free love dealt equally to all?
2 To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
2 Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
2 Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
2 To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.
2 Left for repentance, none for pardon left?
2 While they adore me on the throne of Hell.
2 In misery: Such joy ambition finds.
2 What feigned submission swore?
2 Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
2 Short intermission bought with double smart.
2 Mankind created, and for him this world.
2 As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.
2 Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.
2 As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.
2 Into his nether empire neighbouring round.
2 From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.
2 All path of man or beast that passed that way.
2 So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.
2 To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.
2 Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.
2 Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.
2 And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.
2 Simplicity and spotless innocence!
2 His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.
2 Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.
2 what do mine eyes with grief behold!
2 The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.
2 On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.
2 To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.
2 The tyrant’s plea, excused his devilish deeds.
2 Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.
2 Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.
2 what thou hast said is just and right.
2 Like consort to thyself canst no where find.
2 And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
2 Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.
2 But follow straight, invisibly thus led?
2 And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.
2 Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.
2 Sight hateful, sight tormenting!
2 Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.
2 The proof of their obedience and their faith?
2 What further would be learned.
2 Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!
2 Still as it rose, impossible to climb.
2 Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.
2 Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste.
2 No evil thing approach or enter in.
2 New troubles; him thy care must be to find.
2 To whom the winged warriour thus returned.
2 Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.
2 Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.
2 The clouds that on his western throne attend.
2 And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.
2 And of their doings God takes no account.
2 Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.
2 Is woman’s happiest knowledge, and her praise.
2 All seasons, and their change, all please alike.
2 Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.
2 But wherefore all night long shine these?
2 This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?
2 To whom our general ancestor replied.
2 Perfection from the sun’s more potent ray.
2 Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.
2 Endowed with all their gifts, and O!
2 On him who had stole Jove’s authentick fire.
2 Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
2 And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.
2 Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.
2 But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
2 In Paradise of all things common else!
2 Of father, son, and brother, first were known.
2 Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.
2 To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
2 Showered roses, which the morn repaired.
2 No happier state, and know to know no more.
2 When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.
2 Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
2 That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.
2 Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.
2 Hitherward bent (who could have thought?
2 Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.
2 Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.
2 So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
2 Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.
2 Comest thou, escaped thy prison?
2 Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
2 Your message, like to end as much in vain?
2 To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
2 Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.
2 This place inviolable, and these from harm.
2 Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.
2 Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.
2 Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.
2 How busied, in what form and posture couched.
2 To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
2 Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!
2 To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
2 Lives there who loves his pain!
2 In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked.
2 But that implies not violence or harm.
2 Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.
2 However, and to ’scape his punishment!
2 So judge thou still, presumptuous!
2 Can equal anger infinite provoked.
2 Came not all hell broke loose?
2 The first in flight from pain!
2 Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.
2 To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.
2 And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.
2 To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.
2 Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?
2 O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!
2 Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.
2 Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
2 To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?
2 Fly neither whence thou fledst!
2 The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.
2 Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.
2 In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.
2 Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.
2 Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
2 Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.
2 Heaven’s last best gift, my ever new delight!
2 Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.
2 On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.
2 Whom to behold but thee, Nature’s desire?
2 Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.
2 Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?
2 Longer thy offered good; why else set here?
2 The author not impaired, but honoured more?
2 Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!
2 What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!
2 Related, and thus Adam answered sad.
2 Into her private cell, when nature rests.
2 Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
2 But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
2 Waking thou never will consent to do.
2 Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.
2 And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
2 So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.
2 To add more sweetness; and they thus began.
2 Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then!
2 Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.
2 Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
2 While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.
2 And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.
2 His praise, who out of darkness called up light.
2 Vary to our great Maker still new praise.
2 Rising or falling still advance his praise.
2 With every plant, in sign of worship wave.
2 Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
2 Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
2 Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.
2 Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!
2 Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.
2 His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.
2 In them at once to ruin all mankind.
2 Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.
2 Divine the sovran Architect had framed.
2 Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.
2 For on some message high they guessed him bound.
2 Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.
2 Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called.
2 More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.
2 God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.
2 With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.
2 Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.
2 Be over, and the sun more cool decline.
2 Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.
2 Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.
2 That one celestial Father gives to all.
2 And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
2 Vapours not yet into her substance turned.
2 From her moist continent to higher orbs.
2 Was understood, the injured lover’s hell.
2 Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.
2 To whom the winged Hierarch replied.
2 Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
2 Can comprehend, incapable of more.
2 To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.
2 By steps we may ascend to God.
2 Human desires can seek or apprehend?
2 That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
2 This was that caution given thee; be advised.
2 By destiny, and can no other choose?
2 From what high state of bliss, into what woe!
2 His other half in the great zone of Heaven.
2 After short pause assenting, thus began.
2 Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?
2 Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.
2 Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.
2 Ordained without redemption, without end.
2 All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.
2 Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.
2 With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.
2 Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.
2 Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.
2 Sleepest thou, Companion dear?
2 Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.
2 Drew after him the third part of Heaven’s host.
2 And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.
2 In battle, what our power is, or our right.
2 This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.
2 Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.
2 Impearls on every leaf and every flower.
2 Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.
2 Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!
2 To one, and to his image now proclaimed?
2 Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?
2 Jar not with liberty, but well consist.
2 Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.
2 The current of his fury thus opposed.
2 O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!
2 In place thyself so high above thy peers.
2 One over all with unsucceeded power.
2 Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?
2 While pardon may be found in time besought.
2 The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.
2 That we were formed then sayest thou?
2 Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
2 Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.
2 And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.
2 Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.
2 His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
2 When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.
2 On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.
2 From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
2 Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.
2 His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.
2 Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
2 And thus his own undaunted heart explores.
2 Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?
2 Most reason is that reason overcome.
2 Incensed, and thus securely him defied.
2 How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.
2 Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!
2 As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.
2 To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.
2 Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.
2 This greeting on thy impious crest receive.
2 And flying vaulted either host with fire.
2 And visage all inflamed first thus began.
2 And faithful, now proved false!
2 Brooks not the works of violence and war.
2 Precipitate thee with augmented pain.
2 I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.
2 Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.
2 Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.
2 And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.
2 His confidence to equal God in power.
2 Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.
2 And uncouth pain fled bellowing.
2 Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.
2 Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.
2 Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
2 Therefore eternal silence be their doom.
2 Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.
2 And in the midst thus undismayed began.
2 (And if one day, why not eternal days?
2 Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
2 Due search and consultation will disclose.
2 And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.
2 No less than for deliverance what we owe.
2 Whereto with look composed Satan replied.
2 Believest so main to our success, I bring.
2 So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?
2 The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
2 Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.
2 Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.
2 For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
2 Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
2 With silent circumspection, unespied.
2 Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.
2 But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.
2 And onward moved embattled: When behold!
2 Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.
2 But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!
2 What we propound, and loud that all may hear!
2 Nor served it to relax their serried files.
2 And to his mates thus in derision called.
2 And breast, (what could we more?
2 We should compel them to a quick result.
2 To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.
2 They show us when our foes walk not upright.
2 Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
2 Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!
2 Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
2 The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.
2 Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.
2 By sacred unction, thy deserved right.
2 God, and Messiah his anointed King.
2 And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.
2 Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
2 Whom to obey is happiness entire.
2 Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.
2 Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
2 Under their Head imbodied all in one.
2 And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.
2 Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
2 In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
2 Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
2 To all his host on either hand thus spake.
2 Hath honoured me, according to his will.
2 Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.
2 And full of wrath bent on his enemies.
2 Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.
2 All but the throne itself of God.
2 Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.
2 Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
2 Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.
2 Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
2 Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.
2 Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.
2 Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.
2 Thee once to gain companion of his woe.
2 Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
2 Above the flight of Pegasean wing!
2 Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.
2 Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
2 For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.
2 Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.
2 To magnify his works, the more we know.
2 End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.
2 And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.
2 Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
2 Enough is left besides to search and know.
2 Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.
2 Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.
2 One kingdom, joy and union without end.
2 This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!
2 Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
2 Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.
2 His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
2 So told as earthly notion can receive.
2 His good to worlds and ages infinite.
2 Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
2 And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.
2 Heaven’s highth, and with the center mix the pole.
2 Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!
2 Creation, and the wonders of his might.
2 This be thy just circumference, O World!
2 And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.
2 Both when first evening was, and when first morn.
2 And morning chorus sung the second day.
2 Into one place, and let dry land appear.
2 Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
2 Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.
2 So even and morn recorded the third day.
2 To give light on the Earth; and it was so.
2 And light from darkness to divide.
2 Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.
2 Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.
2 Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.
2 And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.
2 And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.
2 Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.
2 Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.
2 Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.
2 The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.
2 Their snaky folds, and added wings.
2 Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
2 ) thus to his Son audibly spake.
2 And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
2 Express; and thou becamest a living soul.
2 And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
2 Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
2 While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
2 Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.
2 Is greater than created to destroy.
2 The number of thy worshippers.
2 Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.
2 Their pleasant dwelling-place.
2 And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!
2 Their happiness, and persevere upright!
2 With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept.
2 Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
2 Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.
2 Which only thy solution can resolve.
2 Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.
2 And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.
2 Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?
2 Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.
2 Benevolent and facile thus replied.
2 His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.
2 Officious; but to thee, Earth’s habitant.
2 Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.
2 To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
2 Incited, dance about him various rounds?
2 Insensibly three different motions move?
2 Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.
2 Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
2 Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!
2 Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.
2 To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.
2 Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!
2 Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.
2 Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.
2 By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.
2 Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.
2 To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.
2 Destruction with creation might have mixed.
2 Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
2 Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.
2 Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.
2 So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
2 Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.
2 With fragrance and with joy my heart o’erflowed.
2 Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?
2 And feel that I am happier than I know.
2 To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.
2 Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.
2 Above, or round about thee, or beneath.
2 Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.
2 Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.
2 Their element, to draw the thinner air.
2 With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.
2 And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.
2 Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?
2 As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.
2 Their language and their ways?
2 Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.
2 And humble deprecation, thus replied.
2 My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
2 And these inferiour far beneath me set?
2 Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?
2 Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.
2 Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.
2 No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.
2 What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?
2 Second to me or like, equal much less.
2 Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
2 All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!
2 Collateral love, and dearest amity.
2 From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.
2 This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.
2 Thy wish exactly to thy heart’s desire.
2 By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.
2 The spirit of love and amorous delight.
2 In every gesture dignity and love.
2 I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.
2 And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.
2 On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.
2 Against the charm of Beauty’s powerful glance.
2 Elaborate, of inward less exact.
2 About her, as a guard angelick placed.
2 To whom the Angel with contracted brow.
2 Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.
2 Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
2 The soul of man, or passion in him move.
2 Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.
2 To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.
2 More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.
2 Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
2 Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?
2 Us happy, and without love no happiness.
2 As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.
2 Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.
2 Be strong, live happy, and love!
2 The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!
2 Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.
2 And all temptation to transgress repel.
2 Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!
2 Be good and friendly still, and oft return!
2 From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.
2 Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.
2 The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.
2 Active within, beyond the sense of brute.
2 His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.
2 With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
2 For what God, after better, worse would build?
2 Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.
2 Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.
2 Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!
2 To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
2 That to the highth of Deity aspired!
2 From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.
2 Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.
2 And Eve first to her husband thus began.
2 Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?
2 To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.
2 Compare above all living creatures dear!
2 And good works in her husband to promote.
2 Love, not the lowest end of human life.
2 He made us, and delight to reason joined.
2 And short retirement urges sweet return.
2 That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.
2 Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.
2 With sweet austere composure thus replied.
2 Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth’s Lord!
2 Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.
2 May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
2 Can either not receive, or can repel.
2 Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?
2 To whom with healing words Adam replied.
2 Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!
2 The attempt itself, intended by our foe.
2 Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.
2 Angels; nor think superfluous other’s aid.
2 Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.
2 With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?
2 Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.
2 How are we happy, still in fear of harm?
2 Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.
2 Alone, without exteriour help sustained?
2 As not secure to single or combined.
2 And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.
2 To whom thus Adam fervently replied.
2 Against his will he can receive no harm.
2 To do what God expressly hath forbid.
2 That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.
2 Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.
2 Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
2 Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
2 On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!
2 For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.
2 Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.
2 So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
2 Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.
2 Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
2 Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
2 Noontide repast, or afternoon’s repose.
2 Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!
2 The whole included race, his purposed prey.
2 From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.
2 Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.
2 Much he the place admired, the person more.
2 Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.
2 Thoughts, whither have ye led me!
2 Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.
2 She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!
2 The way which to her ruin now I tend.
2 Fold above fold, a surging maze!
2 To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
2 Than at Circean call the herd disguised.
2 Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.
2 His fraudulent temptation thus began.
2 Thou canst, who art sole wonder!
2 Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.
2 By Angels numberless, thy daily train.
2 Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.
2 By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?
2 Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.
2 Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
2 Say, for such wonder claims attention due.
2 To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.
2 Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!
2 Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.
2 Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.
2 Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
2 At feed or fountain, never had I found.
2 Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.
2 Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!
2 Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.
2 But say, where grows the tree?
2 Help to disburden Nature of her birth.
2 To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.
2 There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.
2 Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.
2 Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.
2 Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.
2 To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.
2 Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?
2 To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.
2 Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
2 Raised, as of some great matter to begin.
2 The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.
2 Of highest agents, deemed however wise.
2 To knowledge; by the threatener?
2 Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.
2 Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?
2 Your fear itself of death removes the fear.
2 Knowing both good and evil, as they know.
2 I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.
2 Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.
2 As they, participating God-like food?
2 The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
2 Impart against his will, if all be his?
2 Causes import your need of this fair fruit.
2 Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!
2 Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.
2 And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
2 Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
2 Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!
2 This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?
2 Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.
2 Of God or death, of law or penalty?
2 To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?
2 Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!
2 Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.
2 Thus to herself she pleasingly began.
2 To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.
2 And givest access, though secret she retire.
2 I could endure, without him live no life.
2 As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.
2 New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.
2 Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.
2 Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?
2 The pain of absence from thy sight.
2 Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
2 Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.
2 Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.
2 But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.
2 First to himself he inward silence broke.
2 Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
2 Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!
2 To live again in these wild woods forlorn!
2 Would never from my heart: no, no!
2 Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.
2 Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.
2 Much more to taste it under ban to touch.
2 But past who can recall, or done undo?
2 But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.
2 Most favours; who can please him long?
2 He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?
2 Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.
2 One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.
2 So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.
2 Illustrious evidence, example high!
2 So eminently never had been known?
2 Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
2 And fear of death deliver to the winds.
2 Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.
2 But fondly overcome with female charm.
2 Till Adam thus ’gan Eve to dalliance move.
2 Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.
2 For this one tree had been forbidden ten.
2 Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!
2 Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.
2 And hyacinth; Earth’s freshest softest lap.
2 At length gave utterance to these words constrained.
2 And brown as evening: Cover me, ye Pines!
2 Hide me, where I may never see them more!
2 There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.
2 Their guilt and dreaded shame!
2 Among the trees on isles and woody shores.
2 Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.
2 Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!
2 Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.
2 To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.
2 What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!
2 Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.
2 Was I to have never parted from thy side?
2 As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.
2 Going into such danger, as thou saidst?
2 Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
2 Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.
2 To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.
2 Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve!
2 Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?
2 And force upon free will hath here no place.
2 She first his weak indulgence will accuse.
2 And of their vain contest appeared no end.
2 Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.
2 (Incurred what could they less?
2 And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.
2 With pity, violated not their bliss.
2 Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.
2 When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.
2 On his transgression,—death denounced that day?
2 Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.
2 Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.
2 But whom send I to judge them?
2 All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.
2 And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.
2 Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.
2 Mayest ever rest well pleased.
2 Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
2 Conviction to the serpent none belongs.
2 Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.
2 Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.
2 Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.
2 Absents thee, or what chance detains?
2 Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.
2 Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.
2 Afraid, being naked, hid myself.
2 The gracious Judge without revile replied.
2 Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?
2 To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.
2 Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.
2 She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
2 To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.
2 And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.
2 So having said, he thus to Eve in few.
2 Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?
2 Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.
2 The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.
2 And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.
2 And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.
2 Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.
2 And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.
2 Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.
2 On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.
2 For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.
2 Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.
2 Arraying, covered from his Father’s sight.
2 Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
2 Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.
2 Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
2 For Death from Sin no power can separate.
2 Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.
2 By this new-felt attraction and instinct.
2 Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.
2 Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.
2 Sagacious of his quarry from so far.
2 Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.
2 And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.
2 In sight, to each of these three places led.
2 To Paradise first tending; when, behold!
2 Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.
2 Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.
2 Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased.
2 Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.
2 Such fatal consequence unites us three!
2 Detain from following thy illustrious track.
2 With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.
2 Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.
2 Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.
2 Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
2 Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.
2 No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!
2 Departing gave command, and they observed.
2 Silence, and with these words attention, won.
2 Offended, worth your laughter!
2 To rule, as over all he should have ruled.
2 But up, and enter now into full bliss?
2 They saw, but other sight instead!
2 Cast on themselves from their own mouths.
2 Whom they triumphed once lapsed.
2 To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.
2 And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.
2 On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.
2 Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!
2 Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?
2 Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.
2 To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.
2 To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.
2 And season him thy last and sweetest prey.
2 To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.
2 For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.
2 Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.
2 As sorted best with present things.
2 With terrour through the dark aereal hall.
2 Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
2 Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.
2 Or multiply, but curses on my head?
2 Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!
2 “Wherefore didst thou beget me?
2 Thy punishment then, justly is at his will.
2 That dust I am, and shall to dust return.
2 But I shall die a living death?
2 The doubt, since human reach no further knows.
2 Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?
2 Not to the extent of their own sphere.
2 To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!
2 To Satan only like both crime and doom.
2 I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!
2 Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
2 O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!
2 To answer, and resound far other song.
2 But her with stern regard he thus repelled.
2 Out of my sight, thou Serpent!
2 To hellish falshood, snare them!
2 To human life, and houshold peace confound.
2 His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.
2 Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
2 Me, me only, just object of his ire!
2 And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.
2 The punishment all on thyself; alas!
2 And my displeasure bearest so ill.
2 To me committed, and by me exposed.
2 And to our seed (O hapless seed!
2 To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.
2 As in our evils, and of easier choice.
2 The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
2 Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.
2 Destruction with destruction to destroy?
2 Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.
2 Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.
2 For loss of life and pleasure overloved.
2 The Serpent’s head; piteous amends!
2 Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
2 Was meant by death that day; when lo!
2 The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!
2 In dust, our final rest and native home.
2 Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
2 What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?
2 Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
2 Presenting, thus to intercede began.
2 Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
2 Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
2 To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
2 Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.
2 And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.
2 The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.
2 Good by itself, and evil not at all.
2 The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.
2 Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.
2 With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.
2 Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.
2 Man is to live; and all things live for Man.
2 To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
2 Though after sleepless night; for see!
2 What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
2 Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.
2 Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.
2 Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.
2 And thither must return, and be no more?
2 And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
2 And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam’s eye.
2 While the great visitant approached, thus spake.
2 With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
2 Satan’s dire dread; and in his hand the spear.
2 Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.
2 The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.
2 Discovered soon the place of her retire.
2 O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!
2 Must I thus leave thee Paradise?
2 That must be mortal to us both.
2 Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?
2 With what to sight or smell was sweet!
2 Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?
2 Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.
2 Where he abides, think there thy native soil.
2 To Michael thus his humble words addressed.
2 Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
2 His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?
2 Of glory; and far off his steps adore.
2 To whom thus Michael with regard benign.
2 And reverence thee, their great progenitor.
2 Express, and of his steps the track divine.
2 Thy mortal passage when it comes.
2 As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.
2 To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.
2 Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.
2 To show him all Earth’s kingdoms, and their glory.
2 And from the well of life three drops instilled.
2 Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.
2 Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.
2 Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.
2 Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.
2 Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?
2 To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.
2 both for the deed, and for the cause!
2 Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!
2 More terrible at the entrance, than within.
2 Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.
2 With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.
2 And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.
2 Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!
2 Glad to be so dismissed in peace.
2 And, for his Maker’s image sake, exempt?
2 Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
2 God’s image did not reverence in themselves.
2 I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.
2 To death, and mix with our connatural dust?
2 And now prepare thee for another sight.
2 Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.
2 Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!
2 With feast and musick all the tents resound.
2 The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.
2 Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.
2 Holy and pure, conformity divine.
2 Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.
2 The world erelong a world of tears must weep.
2 To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.
2 Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
2 Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.
2 By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.
2 But now prepare thee for another scene.
2 On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.
2 Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.
2 Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?
2 Produce prodigious births of body or mind.
2 Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
2 And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
2 Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
2 Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.
2 For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!
2 With their four wives; and God made fast the door.
2 All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.
2 And scarce to the Angel utter’dst thus thy plaint.
2 With thought that they must be.
2 Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.
2 And whether here the race of Man will end.
2 Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.
2 A world devote to universal wrack.
2 By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
2 And now, what further shall ensue, behold.
2 His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.
2 Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.
2 Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.
2 Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.
2 Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.
2 As present, heavenly Instructer!
2 With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.
2 From him, and all his anger to forget.
2 Distended, as the brow of God appeased?
2 Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?
2 Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
2 Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.
2 And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.
2 Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
2 Though of rebellion others he accuse.
2 Regardless whether good or evil fame.
2 Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.
2 Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.
2 Reserving, human left from human free.
2 Siege and defiance: Wretched man!
2 And famish him of breath, if not of bread?
2 Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.
2 Servant of servants, on his vicious race.
2 With God, who called him, in a land unknown.
2 Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.
2 With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.
2 Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.
2 His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
2 Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
2 Among them; how can God with such reside?
2 Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.
2 To filial; works of law to works of faith.
2 Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
2 The last; for of his reign shall be no end.
2 Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.
2 Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.
2 To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.
2 Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.
2 With Earth’s wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.
2 Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.
2 Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!
2 Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor’s heel.
2 So only can high Justice rest appaid.
2 To save them, not their own, though legal, works.
2 A gentle wafting to immortal life.
2 For death, like that which the Redeemer died.
2 So in his seed all nations shall be blest.
2 Than this of Eden, and far happier days.
2 Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.
2 O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!
2 From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.
2 Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
2 As did their Lord before them.
2 Though not but by the Spirit understood.
2 Their own faith, not another’s?
2 To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.
2 He ended; and thus Adam last replied.
2 Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.
2 Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
2 Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
2 To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
2 A Paradise within thee, happier far.
2 With meditation on the happy end.
2 And thus with words not sad she him received.
2 Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
2 By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.
2 To the subjected plain; then disappeared.
2 Through Eden took their solitary way.
