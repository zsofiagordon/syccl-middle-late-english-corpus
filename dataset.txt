0 But in prison he moot dwelle alway.
0 But seen his lady shal he never-mo.
0 For I wol telle forth as I bigan.
0 For seen his lady shal he never-mo.
0 That is, or shal, whyl that the world may dure.
0 That lene he wex, and drye as is a shaft.

0 And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.

0 Quod Troilus, `Allas!

0 To lete hir go thus to the Grekes ost.
0 And weyveth wrecches, for hir cowardyse.
0 That she wolde it as now for yvel take.
0 Why sholde than for ferd thyn herte quake?
0 A love; and why shaltow not have another?
0 Though thou do bote a-noon in this mischeef.
0 Thanne is she fals; so love hir wel the lasse.
0 Thourgh love is broken alday every lawe.
0 Have mercy on thy-self, for any awe.
0 And, if thou deye a martir, go to hevene.
0 Thourgh-girt with many a wyd and blody wounde.
0 In every cas I wol a freend be founde.
0 A-dieu, the devel spede him that it recche!
0 To ravisshe hir, but-if hir-self it wolde.
0 `Why, so mene I,' quod Pandarus, `al this day.
0 That sorwest thus?
0 But-if that Iove tolde it in thyn ere?
0 Or he may wondren whider thou art goon.
0 Be glad, and lat me werke in this matere.
0 And fare now wel, for in this point I reste.

0 Yeve hem mischaunce that this tretis broughte.
0 She dorste at no wight asken it, for fere.
0 She wol ben his, whyl that hir lyf may laste.
0 So that she niste what was best to rede.
0 They sette hem doun, and seyde as I shal telle.
0 By-cause of yow, that shal your fader see.
0 For al to litel hath she with us be.
0 That, whan she gooth, almighty god hir gyde!
0 Although the body sat among hem there.
0 With-outen word, alwey on him she thoughte.
0 As she that, al this mene whyle.
0 For wo, and wery of that companye.
0 Of Troilus, and sorowfully she sighte.
0 Departe, and never pleye with hem more.
0 And to be glad they often hir bisoughte.
0 For ache of heed, to clawen him on his hele!
0 They took hir leve, and hoom they wenten alle.
0 And thus she wroughte, as I shal yow devyse.
0 And with the deeth to doon bote on hir bale.
0 Wo worth, allas!
0 That causeth me, and I him, al this peyne!
0 She held hir-self a forlost creature.
0 She seyde, `How shal he doon, and I also?
0 How sholde I live, if that I from him twinne?
0 Who shal that sorwe sleen that ye ben inne?
0 O Calkas, fader, thyn be al this sinne!
0 Wo worth that day that thou me bere on lyve!
0 `To what fyn sholde I live and sorwen thus?
0 How sholde a fish with-oute water dure?
0 What is Criseyde worth, from Troilus?
0 Live, with-oute his kinde noriture?
0 That "rotelees, mot grene sone deye.
0 And thus my-selven wol I do to dethe.
0 Shal sorwe been, compleynte, and abstinence.
0 Eternally, for they shal never twinne.
0 As Orpheus and Erudice, his fere.
0 `Thus, herte myn, for Antenor, allas!
0 I sone shal be chaunged, as I wene.
0 How shal youre tendre herte this sustene?
0 So ye wel fare, I recche not to deye.

0 Hir heigh compleynte, and therfore I it pace.
0 Of deeth, which that hir herte gan desyre.
0 As he that pitee felte on every syde.
0 Tho gan she pleyne a thousand tymes more.
0 That now transmuwed been in cruel wo.

0 `Endeth than love in wo?
0 And alle worldly blisse, as thinketh me.
0 Felinge alwey, fro wikke I go to worse.
0 Peyne, torment, pleynte, wo, distresse.
0 A-noy, smert, drede, fury, and eek siknesse.
0 For pitee of myn aspre and cruel peyne!
0 Quod Pandarus, `what thenkestow to do?
0 Why woltow thus thy-selve, allas, for-do?
0 This, which by me thy Troilus thee sente.
0 ' quod she, `what wordes may ye bringe?
0 Which that I drede never-mo to see?
0 Wol he have pleynte or teres, er I wende?
0 I have y-nowe, if he ther-after sende!
0 Was al y-chaunged in another kinde.
0 Ben fled, and thus lyth now Criseyde allone.
0 The teres from his eyen for to reyne.
0 From Troilus thise wordes to Criseyde.
0 That cause is of this sorwe and this unreste.
0 For verray wo his wit is al aweye.
0 He somwhat is fro weping now with-drawe.
0 Remede in this, if ther were any wyse.
0 As ferforth as my wit can comprehende.
0 And her-upon ye may answere him sende.
0 So leef this wo er Troilus be here.
0 That love him bet than he him-self, I gesse.
0 For me hath he swich hevinesse?
0 Can he for me so pitously compleyne?
0 Y-wis, his sorwe doubleth al my peyne.
0 Dryve out that goost which in myn herte beteth.
0 Fil gruf, and gan to wepe pitously.
0 Quod Pandarus, `Allas!
0 That he shal come?
0 But ye wol have him wood out of his minde!
0 For al the good that Pryam may despende.
0 So leef this sorwe, or platly he wol deye.
0 And with som wysdom ye his sorwes bete.
0 Or though ye bothe in salte teres dreynte?
0 Bet is a tyme of cure ay than of pleynte.
0 Or come ayen, sone after ye be went.
0 And what that I may helpe, it shal not fayle.
0 It shal not lakken, certain, on myn halve.
0 For wel he thoughte ther was non other grace.
0 That outrely he shoop him for to deye.
0 He seyde, he nas but loren, waylawey!
0 Thus to be lorn, it is my destinee.
0 As they shul comen by predestinee.
0 `But nathelees, allas!
0 But that free chois is yeven us everichoon.
0 That I not whos opinion I may holde.

0 Therfore is thyn opinioun sooth, y-wis.
0 Is entrechaunged, bothe in him and thee.
0 That by necessitee they comen alle.

0 That thing to come sholde cause his prescience.
0 For that it is to come, and elles nought?
0 That for-wot al with-outen ignoraunce.
0 They mowe not been eschewed on no syde.
0 Or bring Criseyde and me fro this distresse.
0 Com Pandare in, and seyde as ye may here.
0 Who seigh ever a wys man faren so?
0 Why, Troilus, what thenkestow to done?
0 Hastow swich lust to been thyn owene fo?

0 And how they wroughte, I shal yow telle sone.
0 But hem in armes toke and after kiste.

0 And how himself ther-with he wolde have slawe.
0 And seyde, `O mercy, god, lo, which a dede!
0 How neigh we were bothe dede!
0 Ye wolde han slayn your-self anoon?
0 `Ye, douteless;' and she answerde, `Allas!

0 And Grekes us restore that is mis.
0 Ye may the bettre at ese of herte abyde.

0 And herkeneth how, if that ye wole assente.
0 Mot spenden part, the remenant for to save.
0 And how I mene, I shal it yow devyse.
0 Whyl that this toun stant thus in Iupartye.

0 "Men may the wyse at-renne, and not at-rede.
0 Ne feyne a-right, and that is al my drede.
0 To trusten on, nis but a fantasye.
0 Or do yow doon by force as he shal teche.

0 This is the beste, if that ye wole assente.
0 But afterward, ful sore it wol us rewe.
0 As causeles ye suffren al this drede!

1 a man, and when he is worst, he is little better than a beast.
1 worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make shift to go without him.
1 that temptation without, I know he will choose it.
1 Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
1 You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords.
1 unless I be obtained by the manner of my father’s will.
1 And I pray God grant them a fair departure.
1 Yes, yes, it was Bassanio, as I think, so was he call’d.
1 was the best deserving a fair lady.
1 I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy praise.
1 The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their leave.
1 word the Prince his master will be here tonight.
1 other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach.
1 should shrive me than wive me.
1 we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
1 Enter Bassanio with Shylock the Jew.
1 For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
1 Antonio shall become bound, well.
1 Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio bound.
1 Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
1 you understand me that he is sufficient.
1 there is the peril of waters, winds, and rocks.
1 And that I may be assured, I will bethink me.
1 If it please you to dine with us.
1 Nazarite, conjured the devil into.
1 you, drink with you, nor pray with you.
1 _] How like a fawning publican he looks!
1 The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
1 I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
1 Of full three thousand ducats.
1 Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
1 Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
1 I had forgot, three months, you told me so.
1 The third possessor; ay, he was the third.
1 Directly interest; mark what Jacob did.
1 Fall parti-colour’d lambs, and those were Jacob’s.
1 And thrift is blessing if men steal it not.
1 But sway’d and fashion’d by the hand of heaven.
1 Was this inserted to make interest good?
1 Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
1 I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.
1 The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
1 A goodly apple rotten at the heart.
1 O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
1 Three thousand ducats, ’tis a good round sum.
1 Three months from twelve, then let me see the rate.
1 Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
1 About my moneys and my usances.
1 (For suff’rance is the badge of all our tribe.
1 And all for use of that which is mine own.
1 Well then, it now appears you need my help.
1 “Shylock, we would have moneys.
1 Over your threshold, moneys is your suit.
1 A cur can lend three thousand ducats?
1 I’ll lend you thus much moneys”?
1 To spet on thee again, to spurn thee too.
1 A breed for barren metal of his friend?
1 In what part of your body pleaseth me.
1 And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
1 I’ll rather dwell in my necessity.
1 Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
1 By the exaction of the forfeiture?
1 As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.
1 To buy his favour, I extend this friendship.
1 And for my love I pray you wrong me not.
1 Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
1 This Hebrew will turn Christian; he grows kind.
1 I like not fair terms and a villain’s mind.
1 My ships come home a month before the day.
1 To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.
1 To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
1 Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
1 Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.
1 Come, bring me unto my chance.
1 To make me blest or cursed’st among men!
1 Enter Launcelet Gobbo, the clown, alone.
1 Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master.
1 Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away.
1 ” Well, the most courageous fiend bids me pack.
1 mind,” says the fiend, “and run.
1 kind of taste;—well, my conscience says “Launcelet, budge not.
1 “Budge not,” says my conscience.
1 ” “Fiend,” say I, “you counsel well.

1 Enter Old Gobbo with a basket.
1 Master young man, you, I pray you; which is the way to Master Jew’s?
1 than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me not.
1 Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to Master Jew’s?

1 Talk you of young Master Launcelet?

1 Of Launcelet, an’t please your mastership.

1 The boy was the very staff of my age, my very prop.

1 Alack, sir, I am sand-blind, I know you not.

1 Pray you, sir, stand up, I am sure you are not Launcelet my boy.
1 I cannot think you are my son.
1 man, and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother.
1 It should seem, then, that Dobbin’s tail grows backward.
1 had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him.
1 How dost thou and thy master agree?
1 away, so I will not rest till I have run some ground.
1 You may tell every finger I have with my ribs.

1 O rare fortune, here comes the man!
1 father; for I am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
1 Enter Bassanio with Leonardo and a follower or two.
1 farthest by five of the clock.
1 liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
1 Gramercy, wouldst thou aught with me?
1 Here’s my son, sir, a poor boy.
1 He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve.
1 That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
1 I know thee well; thou hast obtain’d thy suit.
1 The follower of so poor a gentleman.
1 sir: you have “the grace of God”, sir, and he hath “enough”.
1 More guarded than his fellows’; see it done.

1 Well, if Fortune be a woman, she’s a good wench for this gear.
1 Father, come; I’ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.
1 [_Exeunt Launcelet and Old Gobbo.
1 I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.
1 My best esteem’d acquaintance; hie thee, go.
1 My best endeavours shall be done herein.
1 You must not deny me, I must go with you to Belmont.
1 To please his grandam, never trust me more.
1 Well, we shall see your bearing.
1 But we will visit you at supper-time.
1 I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.
1 Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
1 Lorenzo, who is thy new master’s guest.
1 Give him this letter, do it secretly.
1 tears exhibit my tongue, most beautiful pagan, most sweet Jew!
1 If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee, I am much deceived.
1 These foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit.
1 To be ashamed to be my father’s child!
1 Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
1 Enter Gratiano, Lorenzo, Salarino and Solanio.
1 We have not made good preparation.
1 We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.
1 And better in my mind not undertook.
1 Enter Launcelet with a letter.
1 Friend Launcelet, what’s the news?
1 And it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.
1 I will not fail her, speak it privately.
1 Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
1 I am provided of a torch-bearer.
1 Ay, marry, I’ll be gone about it straight.
1 At Gratiano’s lodging some hour hence.
1 [_Exeunt Salarino and Solanio.
1 Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
1 What page’s suit she hath in readiness.
1 That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
1 Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.
1 Enter Shylock the Jew and Launcelet his man that was the clown.
1 The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.
1 As thou hast done with me;—What, Jessica!
1 And sleep, and snore, and rend apparel out.
1 Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing without bidding.
1 I am bid forth to supper, Jessica.
1 I am not bid for love, they flatter me.
1 For I did dream of money-bags tonight.
1 My young master doth expect your reproach.
1 And they have conspired together.
1 out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four year in th’ afternoon.
1 But stop my house’s ears, I mean my casements.
1 I have no mind of feasting forth tonight.
1 Mistress, look out at window for all this.
1 Will be worth a Jewess’ eye.
1 What says that fool of Hagar’s offspring, ha?
1 His words were “Farewell, mistress,” nothing else.
1 A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
1 I have a father, you a daughter, lost.
1 Enter the masquers, Gratiano and Salarino.
1 For lovers ever run before the clock.
1 To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
1 With that keen appetite that he sits down?
1 Are with more spirit chased than enjoy’d.
1 Hugg’d and embraced by the strumpet wind!
1 Lean, rent, and beggar’d by the strumpet wind!
1 Here comes Lorenzo, more of this hereafter.
1 Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode.
1 Not I but my affairs have made you wait.
1 I’ll watch as long for you then.
1 Enter Jessica above, in boy’s clothes.
1 Albeit I’ll swear that I do know your tongue.
1 But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
1 Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
1 Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
1 For I am much asham’d of my exchange.
1 To see me thus transformed to a boy.
1 Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.
1 must I hold a candle to my shames?
1 They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.
1 Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
1 And we are stay’d for at Bassanio’s feast.
1 With some moe ducats, and be with you straight.
1 Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.
1 And true she is, as she hath prov’d herself.
1 Shall she be placed in my constant soul.
1 Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.
1 [_Exit with Jessica and Salarino.
1 ’Tis nine o’clock, our friends all stay for you.
1 Bassanio presently will go aboard.
1 I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
1 Than to be under sail and gone tonight.
1 The several caskets to this noble prince.
1 “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.
1 “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
1 “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.
1 How shall I know if I do choose the right?
1 The one of them contains my picture, prince.
1 If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
1 I will survey the inscriptions back again.
1 “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.
1 I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
1 What says the silver with her virgin hue?
1 “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
1 And weigh thy value with an even hand.
1 May not extend so far as to the lady.
1 Were but a weak disabling of myself.
1 But more than these, in love I do deserve.
1 What if I stray’d no farther, but chose here?
1 “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.
1 Why, that’s the lady, all the world desires her.
1 To kiss this shrine, this mortal breathing saint.
1 For princes to come view fair Portia.
1 As o’er a brook to see fair Portia.
1 One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
1 Is’t like that lead contains her?
1 To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
1 Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
1 Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may.
1 [_He unlocks the golden casket.
1 Often have you heard that told.
1 But my outside to behold.
1 Gilded tombs do worms infold.
1 Fare you well, your suit is cold.
1 Then farewell heat, and welcome frost.
1 Let all of his complexion choose me so.
1 And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
1 Who went with him to search Bassanio’s ship.
1 Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica.
1 They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
1 As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.
1 Of double ducats, stol’n from me by my daughter!
1 She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.
1 Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
1 A vessel of our country richly fraught.
1 And wish’d in silence that it were not his.
1 Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
1 A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
1 As shall conveniently become you there.
1 He wrung Bassanio’s hand, and so they parted.
1 I think he only loves the world for him.
1 Enter Nerissa and a Servitor.
1 Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight.
1 And comes to his election presently.
1 Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz’d.
1 You must be gone from hence immediately.
1 Immediately to leave you and be gone.
1 That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
1 “Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.
1 You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.
1 “Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.
1 Even in the force and road of casualty.
1 And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
1 Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.
1 “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
1 To wear an undeserved dignity.
1 Were purchas’d by the merit of the wearer!
1 How many then should cover that stand bare?
1 How many be commanded that command?
1 “Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.
1 And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
1 [_He opens the silver casket.
1 Too long a pause for that which you find there.
1 How much unlike art thou to Portia!
1 How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
1 “Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.
1 Did I deserve no more than a fool’s head?
1 That did never choose amiss.
1 Such have but a shadow’s bliss.
1 Silver’d o’er, and so was this.
1 So be gone; you are sped.
1 [_Exit Arragon with his train.
1 Thus hath the candle sing’d the moth.
1 They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
1 Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
1 Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
1 So likely an ambassador of love.
1 As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
1 Thou spend’st such high-day wit in praising him.
1 Quick Cupid’s post that comes so mannerly.
1 Bassanio, Lord Love, if thy will it be!
1 made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband.
1 had a title good enough to keep his name company!
1 Why, the end is, he hath lost a ship.
1 I would it might prove the end of his losses.
1 comes in the likeness of a Jew.
1 How now, Shylock, what news among the merchants?
1 You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my daughter’s flight.
1 is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.
1 That’s certain, if the devil may be her judge.
1 My own flesh and blood to rebel!
1 I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.
1 the mart; let him look to his bond.
1 Why, I am sure if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh!
1 bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies.
1 dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
1 If you prick us, do we not bleed?
1 If you poison us, do we not die?
1 If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility?
1 shall go hard but I will better the instruction.
1 We have been up and down to seek him.
1 [_Exeunt Solanio, Salarino and the Servant.
1 How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa?
1 I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
1 Why there, there, there, there!
1 o’ my breathing, no tears but o’ my shedding.
1 Yes, other men have ill luck too.
1 —hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.
1 I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wrack.
1 Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, fourscore ducats.
1 I shall never see my gold again.
1 Fourscore ducats at a sitting!
1 swear he cannot choose but break.
1 I’ll plague him, I’ll torture him.
1 One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey.
1 of Leah when I was a bachelor.
1 But Antonio is certainly undone.
1 Nay, that’s true, that’s very true.
1 bespeak him a fortnight before.
1 forfeit, for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will.
1 Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue.
1 Enter Bassanio, Portia, Gratiano, Nerissa and all their trains.
1 I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.
1 Hate counsels not in such a quality.
1 How to choose right, but then I am forsworn.
1 They have o’erlook’d me and divided me.
1 Puts bars between the owners and their rights!
1 And so though yours, not yours.
1 Let Fortune go to hell for it, not I.
1 For as I am, I live upon the rack.
1 What treason there is mingled with your love.
1 Which makes me fear th’ enjoying of my love.
1 ’Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.
1 Where men enforced do speak anything.
1 Promise me life, and I’ll confess the truth.
1 Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
1 But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
1 If you do love me, you will find me out.
1 Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
1 Let music sound while he doth make his choice.
1 I view the fight than thou that mak’st the fray.
1 A song, whilst Bassanio comments on the caskets to himself.
1 Or in the heart or in the head?
1 How begot, how nourished?
1 In the cradle where it lies.
1 So may the outward shows be least themselves.
1 The world is still deceiv’d with ornament.
1 Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
1 Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.
1 The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
1 And here choose I, joy be the consequence!
1 And shudd’ring fear, and green-ey’d jealousy.
1 In measure rain thy joy; scant this excess!
1 [_Opening the leaden casket_.
1 Should sunder such sweet friends.
1 Doth limp behind the substance.
1 The continent and summary of my fortune.
1 Chance as fair and choose as true!
1 Be content and seek no new.
1 And claim her with a loving kiss.
1 Fair lady, by your leave, [_Kissing her_.
1 I come by note to give and to receive.
1 Until confirm’d, sign’d, ratified by you.
1 As from her lord, her governor, her king.
1 And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
1 Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence.
1 O then be bold to say Bassanio’s dead!
1 For I am sure you can wish none from me.
1 Even at that time I may be married too.
1 With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
1 I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
1 You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid.
1 No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
1 And so did mine too, as the matter falls.
1 Madam, it is, so you stand pleas’d withal.
1 And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
1 Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.
1 We’ll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
1 No, we shall ne’er win at that sport and stake down.
1 What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!
1 Enter Lorenzo, Jessica and Salerio.
1 Have power to bid you welcome.
1 I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.
1 Nerissa, cheer yond stranger, bid her welcome.
1 How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
1 I know he will be glad of our success.
1 We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
1 I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
1 That steals the colour from Bassanio’s cheek.
1 That this same paper brings you.
1 Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman.
1 So keen and greedy to confound a man.
1 Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.
1 It will go hard with poor Antonio.
1 Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
1 Than any that draws breath in Italy.
1 Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond.
1 Shall lose a hair through Bassanio’s fault.
1 And then away to Venice to your friend.
1 To pay the petty debt twenty times over.
1 When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
1 Will live as maids and widows.
1 For you shall hence upon your wedding day.
1 Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
1 But let me hear the letter of your friend.
1 between you and I, if I might but see you at my death.
1 O love, dispatch all business and be gone!
1 Nor rest be interposer ’twixt us twain.
1 Enter Shylock, Salarino, Antonio and Gaoler.
1 This is the fool that lent out money gratis.
1 I’ll have my bond, speak not against my bond.
1 I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
1 The Duke shall grant me justice.
1 To come abroad with him at his request.
1 I’ll have my bond, and therefore speak no more.
1 I’ll have no speaking, I will have my bond.
1 I’ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
1 Many that have at times made moan to me.
1 Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
1 Tomorrow to my bloody creditor.
1 To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.
1 Enter Portia, Nerissa, Lorenzo, Jessica and Balthazar.
1 In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
1 Than customary bounty can enforce you.
1 From out the state of hellish cruelty!
1 Until her husband and my lord’s return.
1 I shall obey you in all fair commands.
1 In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
1 So fare you well till we shall meet again.
1 Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
1 I wish your ladyship all heart’s content.
1 [_Exeunt Jessica and Lorenzo.
1 I shall be there before thee.
1 Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
1 And wish for all that, that I had not kill’d them.
1 If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
1 For we must measure twenty miles today.
1 the children, therefore, I promise you, I fear you.
1 with you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter.
1 of good cheer, for truly I think you are damn’d.
1 And what hope is that, I pray thee?
1 shun Scylla your father, I fall into Charybdis your mother.
1 I shall be saved by my husband.
1 many as could well live one by another.
1 shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
1 I’ll tell my husband, Launcelet, what you say.
1 Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo.
1 in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork.
1 The Moor is with child by you, Launcelet.
1 than an honest woman, she is indeed more than I took her for.
1 How every fool can play upon the word!
1 Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
1 That is done, sir, they have all stomachs.
1 Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you!
1 Then bid them prepare dinner.
1 That is done too, sir, only “cover” is the word.
1 Yet more quarrelling with occasion!
1 meat, and we will come in to dinner.
1 humours and conceits shall govern.
1 O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
1 How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio’s wife?
1 In reason he should never come to heaven.
1 Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
1 Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
1 Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
1 No pray thee, let it serve for table-talk.
1 The very tyranny and rage of his.
1 Go one and call the Jew into the court.
1 Make room, and let him stand before our face.
1 To offices of tender courtesy.
1 We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
1 To have the due and forfeit of my bond.
1 Upon your charter and your city’s freedom!
1 To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
1 I am not bound to please thee with my answer.
1 Do all men kill the things they do not love?
1 Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
1 Every offence is not a hate at first.
1 What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
1 I pray you, think you question with the Jew.
1 As seek to soften that—than which what’s harder?
1 But with all brief and plain conveniency.
1 Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
1 For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
1 I would not draw them, I would have my bond.
1 How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend’ring none?
1 What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
1 “Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
1 Be season’d with such viands”?
1 Is dearly bought; ’tis mine and I will have it.
1 If you deny me, fie upon your law!
1 There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
1 Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
1 Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.
1 Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.
1 Enter Nerissa dressed like a lawyer’s clerk.
1 Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
1 Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
1 To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
1 No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
1 O, be thou damn’d, inexecrable dog!
1 Are wolfish, bloody, starv’d and ravenous.
1 Thou but offend’st thy lungs to speak so loud.
1 A young and learned doctor to our court.
1 To know your answer, whether you’ll admit him.
1 Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
1 Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario’s letter.
1 loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome.
1 We turn’d o’er many books together.
1 importunity to fill up your Grace’s request in my stead.
1 estimation, for I never knew so young a body with so old a head.
1 And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
1 Enter Portia dressed like a doctor of laws.
1 That holds this present question in the court?
1 I am informed throughly of the cause.
1 Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
1 Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
1 ] You stand within his danger, do you not?
1 Then must the Jew be merciful.
1 It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.
1 The throned monarch better than his crown.
1 Must needs give sentence ’gainst the merchant there.
1 The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
1 Is he not able to discharge the money?
1 On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart.
1 Wrest once the law to your authority.
1 And curb this cruel devil of his will.
1 O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
1 I pray you let me look upon the bond.
1 Here ’tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
1 Shylock, there’s thrice thy money offered thee.
1 Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
1 Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
1 When it is paid according to the tenour.
1 You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
1 Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
1 How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
1 Therefore lay bare your bosom.
1 So says the bond, doth it not, noble judge?
1 “Nearest his heart”: those are the very words.
1 To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
1 Is it so nominated in the bond?
1 It is not so express’d, but what of that?
1 ’Twere good you do so much for charity.
1 I cannot find it; ’tis not in the bond.
1 You, merchant, have you anything to say?
1 I am arm’d and well prepar’d.
1 Of such misery doth she cut me off.
1 Say how I lov’d you, speak me fair in death.
1 Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
1 And he repents not that he pays your debt.
1 I’ll pay it instantly with all my heart.
1 Are not with me esteem’d above thy life.
1 Here to this devil, to deliver you.
1 If she were by to hear you make the offer.
1 I have a wife who I protest I love.
1 Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
1 The wish would make else an unquiet house.
1 These be the Christian husbands!
1 Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!
1 We trifle time, I pray thee, pursue sentence.
1 The court awards it and the law doth give it.
1 And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.
1 The law allows it and the court awards it.
1 Tarry a little, there is something else.
1 This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood.
1 Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir’st.
1 The Jew shall have all justice.
1 He shall have nothing but the penalty.
1 O Jew, an upright judge, a learned judge!
1 Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
1 Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
1 A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
1 Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
1 Give me my principal, and let me go.
1 He shall have merely justice and his bond.
1 A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!
1 I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
1 Shall I not have barely my principal?
1 To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
1 Why, then the devil give him good of it!
1 The law hath yet another hold on you.
1 Of the Duke only, ’gainst all other voice.
1 The danger formerly by me rehears’d.
1 Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
1 Therefore thou must be hang’d at the state’s charge.
1 I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
1 Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
1 Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
1 Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.
1 When you do take the means whereby I live.
1 What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
1 A halter gratis, nothing else, for God’s sake!
1 That lately stole his daughter.
1 Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
1 The pardon that I late pronounced here.
1 In christ’ning shalt thou have two god-fathers.
1 To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.
1 Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
1 And it is meet I presently set forth.
1 I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
1 For in my mind you are much bound to him.
1 We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
1 In love and service to you evermore.
1 My mind was never yet more mercenary.
1 I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
1 Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further.
1 Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
1 You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
1 ] Give me your gloves, I’ll wear them for your sake.
1 ] And, for your love, I’ll take this ring from you.
1 And you in love shall not deny me this.
1 I will not shame myself to give you this.
1 And now methinks I have a mind to it.
1 There’s more depends on this than on the value.
1 Only for this I pray you pardon me.
1 I see, sir, you are liberal in offers.
1 You teach me how a beggar should be answer’d.
1 That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.
1 That ’scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
1 My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.
1 Be valued ’gainst your wife’s commandment.
1 And be a day before our husbands home.
1 This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
1 Fair sir, you are well o’erta’en.
1 I pray you show my youth old Shylock’s house.
1 Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
1 But we’ll outface them, and outswear them too.
1 Thou know’st where I will tarry.
1 Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
1 The avenue to Portia’s house.
1 Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
1 But hark, I hear the footing of a man.
1 Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
1 Your name, I pray you, friend?
1 None but a holy hermit and her maid.
1 I pray you is my master yet return’d?
1 He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
1 Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
1 My master will be here ere morning.
1 Sweet soul, let’s in, and there expect their coming.
1 And yet no matter; why should we go in?
1 And bring your music forth into the air.
1 How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
1 Become the touches of sweet harmony.
1 Is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold.
1 Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
1 I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
1 The reason is, your spirits are attentive.
1 But music for the time doth change his nature.
1 And his affections dark as Erebus.
1 That light we see is burning in my hall.
1 How far that little candle throws his beams!
1 So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
1 When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
1 So doth the greater glory dim the less.
1 It is your music, madam, of the house.
1 Nothing is good, I see, without respect.
1 Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
1 Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
1 No better a musician than the wren.
1 To their right praise and true perfection!
1 Or I am much deceiv’d, of Portia.
1 Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
1 Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
1 Your husband is at hand, I hear his trumpet.
1 We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.
1 Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
1 Enter Bassanio, Antonio, Gratiano and their Followers.
1 If you would walk in absence of the sun.
1 And never be Bassanio so for me.
1 You are welcome home, my lord.
1 To whom I am so infinitely bound.
1 For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
1 No more than I am well acquitted of.
1 Sir, you are very welcome to our house.
1 Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
1 In faith, I gave it to the judge’s clerk.
1 Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
1 Upon a knife, “Love me, and leave me not.
1 What talk you of the posy, or the value?
1 And that it should lie with you in your grave.
1 You should have been respective and have kept it.
1 The clerk will ne’er wear hair on’s face that had it.
1 He will, and if he live to be a man.
1 Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
1 I could not for my heart deny it him.
1 And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
1 Never to part with it, and here he stands.
1 An ’twere to me I should be mad at it.
1 And swear I lost the ring defending it.
1 Not that, I hope, which you receiv’d of me.
1 Hath not the ring upon it, it is gone.
1 Even so void is your false heart of truth.
1 You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
1 You would not then have parted with the ring.
1 To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
1 I’ll die for’t but some woman had the ring.
1 What should I say, sweet lady?
1 I was enforc’d to send it after him.
1 I was beset with shame and courtesy.
1 The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
1 No, not my body, nor my husband’s bed.
1 Know him I shall, I am well sure of it.
1 I’ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.
1 How you do leave me to mine own protection.
1 For if I do, I’ll mar the young clerk’s pen.
1 I am th’ unhappy subject of these quarrels.
1 You are welcome notwithstanding.
1 And there’s an oath of credit.
1 I never more will break an oath with thee.
1 Will never more break faith advisedly.
1 And bid him keep it better than the other.
1 Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.
1 By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
1 For by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
1 In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.
1 In summer, where the ways are fair enough.
1 What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv’d it?
1 Here is a letter; read it at your leisure.
1 It comes from Padua from Bellario.
1 Than you expect: unseal this letter soon.
1 Are richly come to harbour suddenly.
1 Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?
1 Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
1 Unless he live until he be a man.
1 Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow.
1 When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
1 My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
1 Ay, and I’ll give them him without a fee.
1 After his death, of all he dies possess’d of.
1 And we will answer all things faithfully.
1 Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.
1 Till I were couching with the doctor’s clerk.
1 So sore as keeping safe Nerissa’s ring.

2 Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.
2 And justify the ways of God to men.
2 For one restraint, lords of the World besides.
2 Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
2 Who durst defy th’ Omnipotent to arms.
2 Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.
2 The dismal situation waste and wild.
2 With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.
2 As from the centre thrice to th’ utmost pole.
2 Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!
2 “If thou beest he—but O how fallen!
2 What though the field be lost?
2 And what is else not to be overcome?
2 Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.
2 Here swallowed up in endless misery.
2 Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?
2 To undergo eternal punishment?
2 His inmost counsels from their destined aim.
2 To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.
2 Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.
2 If not, what resolution from despair.
2 Created hugest that swim th’ ocean-stream.
2 Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.
2 Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.
2 In billows, leave i’ th’ midst a horrid vale.
2 Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.
2 That we must change for Heaven?
2 A mind not to be changed by place or time.
2 Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.
2 Whom thunder hath made greater?
2 Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
2 Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?
2 Which, but th’ Omnipotent, none could have foiled!
2 No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!
2 Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.
2 Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.
2 Under amazement of their hideous change.
2 To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?
2 Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
2 Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!
2 Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.
2 Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.
2 By their rebellion from the Books of Life.
2 And various idols through the heathen world.
2 While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
2 And with their darkness durst affront his light.
2 And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.
2 To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.
2 Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.
2 And works of love or enmity fulfil.
2 And Accaron and Gaza’s frontier bounds.
2 Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.
2 Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.
2 With lust and violence the house of God?
2 Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.
2 Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.
2 And o’er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.
2 Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears.
2 Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.
2 From mortal or immortal minds.
2 Their painful steps o’er the burnt soil.
2 With all his peers: attention held them mute.
2 “O myriads of immortal Spirits!
2 Matchless, but with th’ Almighty!
2 As stood like these, could ever know repulse?
2 Self-raised, and repossess their native seat?
2 Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.
2 By force hath overcome but half his foe.
2 Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.
2 Open or understood, must be resolved.
2 Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.
2 And hands innumerable, scarce perform.
2 Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.
2 To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.
2 Each in his Hierarchy, the Orders bright.
2 With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.
2 Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings.
2 In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides.
2 At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
2 And summons read, the great consult began.
2 “Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!
2 And trust themselves to fear no second fate!
2 That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.
2 “My sentence is for open war.
2 Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.
2 With upright wing against a higher foe!
2 In this abhorred deep to utter woe!
2 We should be quite abolished, and expire.
2 Than miserable to have eternal being!
2 Which, if not victory, is yet revenge.
2 Belial, in act more graceful and humane.
2 For dignity composed, and high exploit.
2 Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
2 Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.
2 Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?
2 His red right hand to plague us?
2 Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
2 Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
2 The sentence of their Conqueror.
2 Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.
2 If we procure not to ourselves more woe.
2 To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.
2 Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar.
2 Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!
2 Magnificence; and what can Heaven show more?
2 In emulation opposite to Heaven.
2 Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven.
2 What sit we then projecting peace and war?
2 In doing what we most in suffering feel?
2 That shook Heaven’s whole circumference confirmed.
2 The weight of all, and our last hope, relies.
2 And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.
2 Barred over us, prohibit all egress.
2 Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.
2 Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?
2 Which he through hazard huge must earn.
2 Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.
2 Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.
2 Or close ambition varnished o’er with zeal.
2 Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.
2 That day and night for his destruction wait!
2 With bright emblazonry, and horrent arms.
2 With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.
2 The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.
2 From either end of heaven the welkin burns.
2 Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.
2 (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?
2 And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.
2 Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!
2 With stubborn patience as with triple steel.
2 Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.
2 Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.
2 Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of fire.
2 Periods of time,—thence hurried back to fire.
2 Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimeras dire.
2 Up to the fiery concave towering high.
2 On either side a formidable Shape.
2 The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
2 With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.
2 That be assured, without leave asked of thee.
2 Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven.
2 To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
2 Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.
2 To join their dark encounter in mid-air.
2 Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.
2 His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both!
2 Me father, and that phantasm call’st my son.
2 Sight more detestable than him and thee.
2 Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.
2 From all her caves, and back resounded Death!
2 That rest or intermission none I find.
2 Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.
2 Save he who reigns above, none can resist.
2 Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey.
2 Fearless to be o’ermatched by living might.
2 Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?
2 Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.
2 Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.
2 Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.
2 Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.
2 And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.
2 And Discord with a thousand various mouths.
2 Erect the standard there of ancient Night.
2 Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge!
2 Made head against Heaven’s King, though overthrown.
2 To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!
2 Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain.
2 Charybdis, and by th’ other whirlpool steered.
2 God and good Angels guard by special grace.
2 Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.
2 Accursed, and in a cursed hour, he hies.
2 Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
2 Whose fountain who shall tell?
2 Won from the void and formless infinite.
2 And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.
2 Of things invisible to mortal sight.
2 Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.
2 Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake.
2 He and his faithless progeny: Whose fault?
2 Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.
2 Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.
2 what praise could they receive?
2 Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.
2 Their freedom: they themselves ordain’d their fall.
2 But Mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine.
2 Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d.
2 Which uttering, thus he to his Father spake.
2 Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.
2 Of all things made, and judgest only right.
2 For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?
2 Be question’d and blasphem’d without defence.
2 To whom the great Creator thus replied.
2 Son of my bosom, Son who art alone.
2 All his deliverance, and to none but me.
2 To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.
2 Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.
2 And to the end, persisting, safe arrive.
2 And none but such from mercy I exclude.
2 The rigid satisfaction, death for death.
2 Say, heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?
2 Man’s mortal crime, and just the unjust to save?
2 Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?
2 The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.
2 His dearest mediation thus renew’d.
2 Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought?
2 Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.
2 My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.
2 Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire.
2 By losing thee a while, the whole race lost.
2 The head of all mankind, though Adam’s son.
2 As many as are restored, without thee none.
2 His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.
2 In those who, when they may, accept not grace.
2 Man’s nature, lessen or degrade thine own.
2 In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell.
2 Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.
2 Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.
2 With joy and peace triumphing, and fair truth.
2 Adore the Son, and honour him as me.
2 Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.
2 Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.
2 Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
2 Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.
2 Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed.
2 Love no where to be found less than Divine!
2 Hail, Son of God, Saviour of Men!
2 Forget, nor from thy Father’s praise disjoin.
2 Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.
2 Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.
2 Betwixt the angelical and human kind.
2 White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.
2 Long after; now unpeopled, and untrod.
2 By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.
2 And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.
2 Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.
2 To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.
2 At sight of all this world beheld so fair.
2 So wonderously was set his station bright.
2 Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.
2 Drained through a limbeck to his native form.
2 Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?
2 He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.
2 His journey’s end and our beginning woe.
2 Before his decent steps a silver wand.
2 O’er sea and land: him Satan thus accosts.
2 To serve him better: Wise are all his ways.
2 In his uprightness, answer thus returned.
2 That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?
2 The rest in circuit walls this universe.
2 And in her pale dominion checks the night.
2 Adam’s abode; those lofty shades, his bower.
2 Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.
2 Nor staid, till on Niphates’ top he lights.
2 Woe to the inhabitants on earth!
2 Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.
2 Then, much revolving, thus in sighs began.
2 Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.
2 Or from without, to all temptations armed.
2 Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
2 But Heaven’s free love dealt equally to all?
2 To me alike, it deals eternal woe.
2 Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
2 Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
2 To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven.
2 Left for repentance, none for pardon left?
2 While they adore me on the throne of Hell.
2 In misery: Such joy ambition finds.
2 What feigned submission swore?
2 Vows made in pain, as violent and void.
2 Short intermission bought with double smart.
2 Mankind created, and for him this world.
2 As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.
2 Him counterfeit, if any eye beheld.
2 As he supposed, all unobserved, unseen.
2 Into his nether empire neighbouring round.
2 From Media post to Egypt, there fast bound.
2 All path of man or beast that passed that way.
2 So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.
2 To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.
2 Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill.
2 Her crystal mirrour holds, unite their streams.
2 And sweet, reluctant, amorous delay.
2 Simplicity and spotless innocence!
2 His sons, the fairest of her daughters Eve.
2 Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad.
2 what do mine eyes with grief behold!
2 The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured.
2 On you who wrong me not for him who wronged.
2 To do what else, though damned, I should abhor.
2 The tyrant’s plea, excused his devilish deeds.
2 Turned him, all ear to hear new utterance flow.
2 Which were it toilsome, yet with thee were sweet.
2 what thou hast said is just and right.
2 Like consort to thyself canst no where find.
2 And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.
2 Smooth lake, that to me seemed another sky.
2 But follow straight, invisibly thus led?
2 And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.
2 Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.
2 Sight hateful, sight tormenting!
2 Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.
2 The proof of their obedience and their faith?
2 What further would be learned.
2 Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed!
2 Still as it rose, impossible to climb.
2 Hung high with diamond flaming, and with gold.
2 Impetuous winds: He thus began in haste.
2 No evil thing approach or enter in.
2 New troubles; him thy care must be to find.
2 To whom the winged warriour thus returned.
2 Spiritual substance with corporeal bar.
2 Thou tellest, by morrow dawning I shall know.
2 The clouds that on his western throne attend.
2 And o’er the dark her silver mantle threw.
2 And of their doings God takes no account.
2 Mean while, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.
2 Is woman’s happiest knowledge, and her praise.
2 All seasons, and their change, all please alike.
2 Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.
2 But wherefore all night long shine these?
2 This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?
2 To whom our general ancestor replied.
2 Perfection from the sun’s more potent ray.
2 Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.
2 Endowed with all their gifts, and O!
2 On him who had stole Jove’s authentick fire.
2 Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.
2 And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.
2 Pure, and commands to some, leaves free to all.
2 But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?
2 In Paradise of all things common else!
2 Of father, son, and brother, first were known.
2 Present, or past, as saints and patriarchs used.
2 To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.
2 Showered roses, which the morn repaired.
2 No happier state, and know to know no more.
2 When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.
2 Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
2 That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.
2 Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.
2 Hitherward bent (who could have thought?
2 Such, where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.
2 Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride.
2 So started up in his own shape the Fiend.
2 Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.
2 Comest thou, escaped thy prison?
2 Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
2 Your message, like to end as much in vain?
2 To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
2 Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul.
2 This place inviolable, and these from harm.
2 Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.
2 Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.
2 Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.
2 How busied, in what form and posture couched.
2 To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
2 Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss!
2 To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
2 Lives there who loves his pain!
2 In that dark durance: Thus much what was asked.
2 But that implies not violence or harm.
2 Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.
2 However, and to ’scape his punishment!
2 So judge thou still, presumptuous!
2 Can equal anger infinite provoked.
2 Came not all hell broke loose?
2 The first in flight from pain!
2 Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.
2 To which the Fiend thus answered, frowning stern.
2 And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.
2 To whom the warriour Angel soon replied.
2 Satan, and couldst thou faithful add?
2 O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!
2 Army of Fiends, fit body to fit head.
2 Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
2 To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?
2 Fly neither whence thou fledst!
2 The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred.
2 Gave heed, but waxing more in rage replied.
2 In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.
2 Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend.
2 Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
2 Her hand soft touching, whispered thus.
2 Heaven’s last best gift, my ever new delight!
2 Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.
2 On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.
2 Whom to behold but thee, Nature’s desire?
2 Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.
2 Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?
2 Longer thy offered good; why else set here?
2 The author not impaired, but honoured more?
2 Here, happy creature, fair angelick Eve!
2 What life the Gods live there, and such live thou!
2 Related, and thus Adam answered sad.
2 Into her private cell, when nature rests.
2 Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
2 But with addition strange; yet be not sad.
2 Waking thou never will consent to do.
2 Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.
2 And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
2 So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.
2 To add more sweetness; and they thus began.
2 Thus wonderous fair; Thyself how wonderous then!
2 Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.
2 Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
2 While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.
2 And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.
2 His praise, who out of darkness called up light.
2 Vary to our great Maker still new praise.
2 Rising or falling still advance his praise.
2 With every plant, in sign of worship wave.
2 Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.
2 Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.
2 Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.
2 Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark!
2 Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.
2 His marriage with the seventimes-wedded maid.
2 In them at once to ruin all mankind.
2 Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.
2 Divine the sovran Architect had framed.
2 Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies.
2 For on some message high they guessed him bound.
2 Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.
2 Berry or grape: To whom thus Adam called.
2 More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.
2 God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven.
2 With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.
2 Dazzles the croud, and sets them all agape.
2 Be over, and the sun more cool decline.
2 Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild.
2 Long after to blest Mary, second Eve.
2 That one celestial Father gives to all.
2 And corporeal to incorporeal turn.
2 Vapours not yet into her substance turned.
2 From her moist continent to higher orbs.
2 Was understood, the injured lover’s hell.
2 Thus to the empyreal minister he framed.
2 To whom the winged Hierarch replied.
2 Differing but in degree, of kind the same.
2 Can comprehend, incapable of more.
2 To whom the patriarch of mankind replied.
2 By steps we may ascend to God.
2 Human desires can seek or apprehend?
2 That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.
2 This was that caution given thee; be advised.
2 By destiny, and can no other choose?
2 From what high state of bliss, into what woe!
2 His other half in the great zone of Heaven.
2 After short pause assenting, thus began.
2 Each to other like, more than on earth is thought?
2 Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.
2 Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand.
2 Ordained without redemption, without end.
2 All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.
2 Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.
2 With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.
2 Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaired.
2 Awakening, thus to him in secret spake.
2 Sleepest thou, Companion dear?
2 Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.
2 Drew after him the third part of Heaven’s host.
2 And, smiling, to his only Son thus said.
2 In battle, what our power is, or our right.
2 This our high place, our sanctuary, our hill.
2 Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.
2 Impearls on every leaf and every flower.
2 Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears.
2 Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!
2 To one, and to his image now proclaimed?
2 Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke?
2 Jar not with liberty, but well consist.
2 Our being ordained to govern, not to serve.
2 The current of his fury thus opposed.
2 O argument blasphemous, false, and proud!
2 In place thyself so high above thy peers.
2 One over all with unsucceeded power.
2 Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?
2 While pardon may be found in time besought.
2 The Apostate, and, more haughty, thus replied.
2 That we were formed then sayest thou?
2 Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?
2 Of this our native Heaven, ethereal sons.
2 And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.
2 Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold.
2 His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.
2 When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.
2 On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed.
2 From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
2 Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.
2 His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.
2 Of onset ended soon each milder thought.
2 And thus his own undaunted heart explores.
2 Where boldest, though to fight unconquerable?
2 Most reason is that reason overcome.
2 Incensed, and thus securely him defied.
2 How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.
2 Ministring Spirits, trained up in feast and song!
2 As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.
2 To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied.
2 Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.
2 This greeting on thy impious crest receive.
2 And flying vaulted either host with fire.
2 And visage all inflamed first thus began.
2 And faithful, now proved false!
2 Brooks not the works of violence and war.
2 Precipitate thee with augmented pain.
2 I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.
2 Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.
2 Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.
2 And all his armour stained, ere while so bright.
2 His confidence to equal God in power.
2 Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.
2 And uncouth pain fled bellowing.
2 Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.
2 Of Ramiel scorched and blasted, overthrew.
2 Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.
2 Therefore eternal silence be their doom.
2 Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.
2 And in the midst thus undismayed began.
2 (And if one day, why not eternal days?
2 Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.
2 Due search and consultation will disclose.
2 And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake.
2 No less than for deliverance what we owe.
2 Whereto with look composed Satan replied.
2 Believest so main to our success, I bring.
2 So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?
2 The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.
2 Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.
2 Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.
2 For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
2 Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
2 With silent circumspection, unespied.
2 Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried.
2 But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.
2 And onward moved embattled: When behold!
2 Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.
2 But that I doubt; however witness, Heaven!
2 What we propound, and loud that all may hear!
2 Nor served it to relax their serried files.
2 And to his mates thus in derision called.
2 And breast, (what could we more?
2 We should compel them to a quick result.
2 To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.
2 They show us when our foes walk not upright.
2 Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
2 Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!
2 Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.
2 The Assessour of his throne, he thus began.
2 Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.
2 By sacred unction, thy deserved right.
2 God, and Messiah his anointed King.
2 And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.
2 Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.
2 Whom to obey is happiness entire.
2 Hymns of high praise, and I among them Chief.
2 Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
2 Under their Head imbodied all in one.
2 And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.
2 Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
2 In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
2 Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
2 To all his host on either hand thus spake.
2 Hath honoured me, according to his will.
2 Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.
2 And full of wrath bent on his enemies.
2 Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.
2 All but the throne itself of God.
2 Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.
2 Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
2 Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.
2 Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.
2 Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.
2 Her mural breach, returning whence it rolled.
2 Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.
2 Thee once to gain companion of his woe.
2 Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.
2 Above the flight of Pegasean wing!
2 Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.
2 Urania, and fit audience find, though few.
2 For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.
2 Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest.
2 To magnify his works, the more we know.
2 End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.
2 And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.
2 Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
2 Enough is left besides to search and know.
2 Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.
2 Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake.
2 One kingdom, joy and union without end.
2 This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!
2 Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
2 Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.
2 His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
2 So told as earthly notion can receive.
2 His good to worlds and ages infinite.
2 Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
2 And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.
2 Heaven’s highth, and with the center mix the pole.
2 Said then the Omnifick Word; your discord end!
2 Creation, and the wonders of his might.
2 This be thy just circumference, O World!
2 And Earth self-balanced on her center hung.
2 Both when first evening was, and when first morn.
2 And morning chorus sung the second day.
2 Into one place, and let dry land appear.
2 Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
2 Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.
2 So even and morn recorded the third day.
2 To give light on the Earth; and it was so.
2 And light from darkness to divide.
2 Her gathered beams, great palace now of light.
2 Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.
2 Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven.
2 And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying.
2 And let the fowl be multiplied, on the Earth.
2 Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.
2 Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day.
2 Pasturing at once, and in broad herds upsprung.
2 The river-horse, and scaly crocodile.
2 Their snaky folds, and added wings.
2 Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
2 ) thus to his Son audibly spake.
2 And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.
2 Express; and thou becamest a living soul.
2 And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
2 Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.
2 While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
2 Fuming from golden censers, hid the mount.
2 Is greater than created to destroy.
2 The number of thy worshippers.
2 Thou usest, and from thence createst more good.
2 Their pleasant dwelling-place.
2 And sons of Men, whom God hath thus advanced!
2 Their happiness, and persevere upright!
2 With halleluiahs: Thus was sabbath kept.
2 Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.
2 Then, as new waked, thus gratefully replied.
2 Which only thy solution can resolve.
2 Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.
2 And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.
2 Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?
2 Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.
2 Benevolent and facile thus replied.
2 His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.
2 Officious; but to thee, Earth’s habitant.
2 Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.
2 To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.
2 Incited, dance about him various rounds?
2 Insensibly three different motions move?
2 Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.
2 Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
2 Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!
2 Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.
2 To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.
2 Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!
2 Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain.
2 Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.
2 By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.
2 Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.
2 To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.
2 Destruction with creation might have mixed.
2 Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
2 Ere sabbath-evening: so we had in charge.
2 Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.
2 So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.
2 Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.
2 With fragrance and with joy my heart o’erflowed.
2 Tell, if ye saw, how I came thus, how here?
2 And feel that I am happier than I know.
2 To the garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.
2 Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed.
2 Above, or round about thee, or beneath.
2 Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed.
2 Or live in sea, or air; beast, fish, and fowl.
2 Their element, to draw the thinner air.
2 With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.
2 And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed.
2 Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?
2 As with a smile more brightened, thus replied.
2 Their language and their ways?
2 Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.
2 And humble deprecation, thus replied.
2 My Maker, be propitious while I speak.
2 And these inferiour far beneath me set?
2 Can sort, what harmony, or true delight?
2 Worse then can man with beast, and least of all.
2 Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased.
2 No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.
2 What thinkest thou then of me, and this my state?
2 Second to me or like, equal much less.
2 Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
2 All human thoughts come short, Supreme of things!
2 Collateral love, and dearest amity.
2 From prone; nor in their ways complacence find.
2 This answer from the gracious Voice Divine.
2 Thy wish exactly to thy heart’s desire.
2 By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.
2 The spirit of love and amorous delight.
2 In every gesture dignity and love.
2 I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud.
2 And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.
2 On his hill top, to light the bridal lamp.
2 Against the charm of Beauty’s powerful glance.
2 Elaborate, of inward less exact.
2 About her, as a guard angelick placed.
2 To whom the Angel with contracted brow.
2 Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.
2 Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.
2 The soul of man, or passion in him move.
2 Among the beasts no mate for thee was found.
2 To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied.
2 More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.
2 Approve the best, and follow what I approve.
2 Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?
2 Us happy, and without love no happiness.
2 As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.
2 Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.
2 Be strong, live happy, and love!
2 The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!
2 Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.
2 And all temptation to transgress repel.
2 Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!
2 Be good and friendly still, and oft return!
2 From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.
2 Not hers, who brings it nightly to my ear.
2 The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.
2 Active within, beyond the sense of brute.
2 His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.
2 With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
2 For what God, after better, worse would build?
2 Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.
2 Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.
2 Him lord pronounced; and, O indignity!
2 To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.
2 That to the highth of Deity aspired!
2 From dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.
2 Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.
2 And Eve first to her husband thus began.
2 Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned?
2 To whom mild answer Adam thus returned.
2 Compare above all living creatures dear!
2 And good works in her husband to promote.
2 Love, not the lowest end of human life.
2 He made us, and delight to reason joined.
2 And short retirement urges sweet return.
2 That gave thee being, still shades thee, and protects.
2 Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.
2 With sweet austere composure thus replied.
2 Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth’s Lord!
2 Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.
2 May tempt it, I expected not to hear.
2 Can either not receive, or can repel.
2 Adam, mis-thought of her to thee so dear?
2 To whom with healing words Adam replied.
2 Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!
2 The attempt itself, intended by our foe.
2 Or daring, first on me the assault shall light.
2 Angels; nor think superfluous other’s aid.
2 Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.
2 With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?
2 Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed.
2 How are we happy, still in fear of harm?
2 Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event.
2 Alone, without exteriour help sustained?
2 As not secure to single or combined.
2 And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed.
2 To whom thus Adam fervently replied.
2 Against his will he can receive no harm.
2 To do what God expressly hath forbid.
2 That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me.
2 Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.
2 Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
2 Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
2 On what thou hast of virtue; summon all!
2 For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.
2 Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied.
2 So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
2 Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.
2 Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
2 Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
2 Noontide repast, or afternoon’s repose.
2 Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss!
2 The whole included race, his purposed prey.
2 From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.
2 Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.
2 Much he the place admired, the person more.
2 Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.
2 Thoughts, whither have ye led me!
2 Enfeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.
2 She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods!
2 The way which to her ruin now I tend.
2 Fold above fold, a surging maze!
2 To interrupt, side-long he works his way.
2 Than at Circean call the herd disguised.
2 Fawning; and licked the ground whereon she trod.
2 His fraudulent temptation thus began.
2 Thou canst, who art sole wonder!
2 Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.
2 By Angels numberless, thy daily train.
2 Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake.
2 By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed?
2 Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.
2 Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?
2 Say, for such wonder claims attention due.
2 To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied.
2 Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!
2 Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.
2 Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.
2 Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.
2 At feed or fountain, never had I found.
2 Wanted not long; though to this shape retained.
2 Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!
2 Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied.
2 But say, where grows the tree?
2 Help to disburden Nature of her birth.
2 To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad.
2 There swallowed up and lost, from succour far.
2 Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.
2 Wonderous indeed, if cause of such effects.
2 Law to ourselves; our reason is our law.
2 To whom the Tempter guilefully replied.
2 Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?
2 To whom thus Eve, yet sinless.
2 Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
2 Raised, as of some great matter to begin.
2 The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began.
2 Of highest agents, deemed however wise.
2 To knowledge; by the threatener?
2 Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.
2 Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?
2 Your fear itself of death removes the fear.
2 Knowing both good and evil, as they know.
2 I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.
2 Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring.
2 As they, participating God-like food?
2 The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?
2 Impart against his will, if all be his?
2 Causes import your need of this fair fruit.
2 Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste!
2 Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused.
2 And yet unknown, is as not had at all.
2 Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?
2 Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die!
2 This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?
2 Friendly to man, far from deceit or guile.
2 Of God or death, of law or penalty?
2 To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?
2 Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked, she eat!
2 Of knowledge; not was Godhead from her thought.
2 Thus to herself she pleasingly began.
2 To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed.
2 And givest access, though secret she retire.
2 I could endure, without him live no life.
2 As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.
2 New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.
2 Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.
2 Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?
2 The pain of absence from thy sight.
2 Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.
2 Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.
2 Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.
2 But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.
2 First to himself he inward silence broke.
2 Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!
2 Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!
2 To live again in these wild woods forlorn!
2 Would never from my heart: no, no!
2 Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.
2 Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned.
2 Much more to taste it under ban to touch.
2 But past who can recall, or done undo?
2 But to be Gods, or Angels, demi-Gods.
2 Most favours; who can please him long?
2 He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?
2 Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.
2 One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself.
2 So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied.
2 Illustrious evidence, example high!
2 So eminently never had been known?
2 Hath touched my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.
2 And fear of death deliver to the winds.
2 Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.
2 But fondly overcome with female charm.
2 Till Adam thus ’gan Eve to dalliance move.
2 Yield thee, so well this day thou hast purveyed.
2 For this one tree had been forbidden ten.
2 Than ever; bounty of this virtuous tree!
2 Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.
2 And hyacinth; Earth’s freshest softest lap.
2 At length gave utterance to these words constrained.
2 And brown as evening: Cover me, ye Pines!
2 Hide me, where I may never see them more!
2 There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.
2 Their guilt and dreaded shame!
2 Among the trees on isles and woody shores.
2 Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed.
2 Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!
2 Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.
2 To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve.
2 What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe!
2 Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm.
2 Was I to have never parted from thy side?
2 As good have grown there still a lifeless rib.
2 Going into such danger, as thou saidst?
2 Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.
2 Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me.
2 To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied.
2 Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve!
2 Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?
2 And force upon free will hath here no place.
2 She first his weak indulgence will accuse.
2 And of their vain contest appeared no end.
2 Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.
2 (Incurred what could they less?
2 And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.
2 With pity, violated not their bliss.
2 Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice.
2 When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.
2 On his transgression,—death denounced that day?
2 Forbearance no acquittance, ere day end.
2 Justice shall not return as bounty scorned.
2 But whom send I to judge them?
2 All judgement, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.
2 And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen.
2 Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild.
2 Mayest ever rest well pleased.
2 Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.
2 Conviction to the serpent none belongs.
2 Eden, and all the coast, in prospect lay.
2 Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.
2 Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud.
2 Absents thee, or what chance detains?
2 Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.
2 Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief.
2 Afraid, being naked, hid myself.
2 The gracious Judge without revile replied.
2 Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?
2 To whom thus Adam sore beset replied.
2 Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.
2 She gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
2 To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied.
2 And person, hadst thou known thyself aright.
2 So having said, he thus to Eve in few.
2 Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?
2 Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied.
2 The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat.
2 And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.
2 And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.
2 Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.
2 And to the Woman thus his sentence turned.
2 Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule.
2 On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced.
2 For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return.
2 Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more.
2 Arraying, covered from his Father’s sight.
2 Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.
2 Sin opening; who thus now to Death began.
2 Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.
2 For Death from Sin no power can separate.
2 Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.
2 By this new-felt attraction and instinct.
2 Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon.
2 Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.
2 Sagacious of his quarry from so far.
2 Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.
2 And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.
2 In sight, to each of these three places led.
2 To Paradise first tending; when, behold!
2 Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.
2 Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.
2 Of that stupendous bridge his joy encreased.
2 Enchanting daughter, thus the silence broke.
2 Such fatal consequence unites us three!
2 Detain from following thy illustrious track.
2 With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.
2 Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne.
2 Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad.
2 Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
2 Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.
2 No detriment need fear; go, and be strong!
2 Departing gave command, and they observed.
2 Silence, and with these words attention, won.
2 Offended, worth your laughter!
2 To rule, as over all he should have ruled.
2 But up, and enter now into full bliss?
2 They saw, but other sight instead!
2 Cast on themselves from their own mouths.
2 Whom they triumphed once lapsed.
2 To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.
2 And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.
2 On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.
2 Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!
2 Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?
2 Whom thus the Sin-born monster answered soon.
2 To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corps.
2 To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.
2 And season him thy last and sweetest prey.
2 To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.
2 For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.
2 Till then, the curse pronounced on both precedes.
2 As sorted best with present things.
2 With terrour through the dark aereal hall.
2 Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
2 Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.
2 Or multiply, but curses on my head?
2 Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!
2 “Wherefore didst thou beget me?
2 Thy punishment then, justly is at his will.
2 That dust I am, and shall to dust return.
2 But I shall die a living death?
2 The doubt, since human reach no further knows.
2 Wrath without end on Man, whom death must end?
2 Not to the extent of their own sphere.
2 To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!
2 To Satan only like both crime and doom.
2 I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!
2 Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
2 O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!
2 To answer, and resound far other song.
2 But her with stern regard he thus repelled.
2 Out of my sight, thou Serpent!
2 To hellish falshood, snare them!
2 To human life, and houshold peace confound.
2 His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.
2 Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
2 Me, me only, just object of his ire!
2 And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon.
2 The punishment all on thyself; alas!
2 And my displeasure bearest so ill.
2 To me committed, and by me exposed.
2 And to our seed (O hapless seed!
2 To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied.
2 As in our evils, and of easier choice.
2 The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.
2 Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.
2 Destruction with destruction to destroy?
2 Had entertained, as dyed her cheeks with pale.
2 Labouring had raised; and thus to Eve replied.
2 For loss of life and pleasure overloved.
2 The Serpent’s head; piteous amends!
2 Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
2 Was meant by death that day; when lo!
2 The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!
2 In dust, our final rest and native home.
2 Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
2 What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?
2 Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
2 Presenting, thus to intercede began.
2 Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
2 Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
2 To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
2 Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.
2 And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed.
2 The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will.
2 Good by itself, and evil not at all.
2 The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.
2 Bewailing their excess,) all terrour hide.
2 With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.
2 Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.
2 Man is to live; and all things live for Man.
2 To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek.
2 Though after sleepless night; for see!
2 What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
2 Here let us live, though in fallen state, content.
2 Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.
2 Pursuing, not unmoved, to Eve thus spake.
2 And thither must return, and be no more?
2 And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
2 And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam’s eye.
2 While the great visitant approached, thus spake.
2 With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
2 Satan’s dire dread; and in his hand the spear.
2 Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.
2 The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.
2 Discovered soon the place of her retire.
2 O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!
2 Must I thus leave thee Paradise?
2 That must be mortal to us both.
2 Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?
2 With what to sight or smell was sweet!
2 Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?
2 Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild.
2 Where he abides, think there thy native soil.
2 To Michael thus his humble words addressed.
2 Therefore to his great bidding I submit.
2 His bright appearances, or foot-step trace?
2 Of glory; and far off his steps adore.
2 To whom thus Michael with regard benign.
2 And reverence thee, their great progenitor.
2 Express, and of his steps the track divine.
2 Thy mortal passage when it comes.
2 As once thou sleptst, while she to life was formed.
2 To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.
2 Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.
2 To show him all Earth’s kingdoms, and their glory.
2 And from the well of life three drops instilled.
2 Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.
2 Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds.
2 Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused.
2 Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried.
2 Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?
2 To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied.
2 both for the deed, and for the cause!
2 Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!
2 More terrible at the entrance, than within.
2 Dropsies, and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.
2 With vows, as their chief good, and final hope.
2 And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed.
2 Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!
2 Glad to be so dismissed in peace.
2 And, for his Maker’s image sake, exempt?
2 Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.
2 God’s image did not reverence in themselves.
2 I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.
2 To death, and mix with our connatural dust?
2 And now prepare thee for another sight.
2 Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.
2 Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!
2 With feast and musick all the tents resound.
2 The bent of nature; which he thus expressed.
2 Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.
2 Holy and pure, conformity divine.
2 Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.
2 The world erelong a world of tears must weep.
2 To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft.
2 Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!
2 Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.
2 By wisdom, and superiour gifts received.
2 But now prepare thee for another scene.
2 On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.
2 Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.
2 Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?
2 Produce prodigious births of body or mind.
2 Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
2 And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
2 Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
2 Allured them; thence from cups to civil broils.
2 For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!
2 With their four wives; and God made fast the door.
2 All left, in one small bottom swum imbarked.
2 And scarce to the Angel utter’dst thus thy plaint.
2 With thought that they must be.
2 Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.
2 And whether here the race of Man will end.
2 Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.
2 A world devote to universal wrack.
2 By men who there frequent, or therein dwell.
2 And now, what further shall ensue, behold.
2 His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.
2 Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.
2 Towards the retreating sea, their furious tide.
2 Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.
2 Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth.
2 As present, heavenly Instructer!
2 With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.
2 From him, and all his anger to forget.
2 Distended, as the brow of God appeased?
2 Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?
2 Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
2 Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.
2 And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.
2 Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
2 Though of rebellion others he accuse.
2 Regardless whether good or evil fame.
2 Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.
2 Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.
2 Reserving, human left from human free.
2 Siege and defiance: Wretched man!
2 And famish him of breath, if not of bread?
2 Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.
2 Servant of servants, on his vicious race.
2 With God, who called him, in a land unknown.
2 Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.
2 With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.
2 Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.
2 His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
2 Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
2 Among them; how can God with such reside?
2 Perform; and, not performing, cannot live.
2 To filial; works of law to works of faith.
2 Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
2 The last; for of his reign shall be no end.
2 Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.
2 Left in confusion; Babylon thence called.
2 To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.
2 Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.
2 With Earth’s wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.
2 Without the vent of words; which these he breathed.
2 Of God Most High: so God with Man unites!
2 Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the victor’s heel.
2 So only can high Justice rest appaid.
2 To save them, not their own, though legal, works.
2 A gentle wafting to immortal life.
2 For death, like that which the Redeemer died.
2 So in his seed all nations shall be blest.
2 Than this of Eden, and far happier days.
2 Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.
2 O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!
2 From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.
2 Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
2 As did their Lord before them.
2 Though not but by the Spirit understood.
2 Their own faith, not another’s?
2 To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss.
2 He ended; and thus Adam last replied.
2 Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.
2 Beyond which was my folly to aspire.
2 Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
2 To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
2 A Paradise within thee, happier far.
2 With meditation on the happy end.
2 And thus with words not sad she him received.
2 Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
2 By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.
2 To the subjected plain; then disappeared.
2 Through Eden took their solitary way.

2 And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.
2 Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.
2 From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.
2 Destined to this, is late of woman born.
2 Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.
2 To do him honour as their King.
2 Thenceforth the nations may not doubt.
2 ‘This is my Son beloved,—in him am pleased.
2 And what will He not do to advance his Son?
2 The glimpses of his Father’s glory shine.
2 Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.
2 Induces best to hope of like success.
2 Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.
2 Great in renown, and called the Son of God.
2 Whate’er his cruel malice could invent.
2 To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.
2 To earn salvation for the sons of men.
2 But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!
2 Allure, or terrify, or undermine.
2 And, devilish machinations, come to nought!
2 So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.
2 Ill sorting with my present state compared!
2 Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.
2 By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.
2 All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.
2 And of thy kingdom there should be no end.
2 For in the inn was left no better room.
2 By which they knew thee King of Israel born.
2 Like things of thee to all that present stood.
2 Full weight must be transferred upon my head.
2 Before Messiah, and his way prepare!
2 As much his greater, and was hardly won.
2 The authority which I derived from Heaven.
2 For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.
2 A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.
2 Such solitude before choicest society.
2 The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.
2 His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.
2 What happens new; fame also finds us out.
2 Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek.
2 Men to much misery and hardship born.
2 With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.
2 “Think’st thou such force in bread?
2 Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.
2 Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?
2 Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.
2 Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.
2 Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?
2 Whereby they may direct their future life.
2 Companions of my misery and woe!
2 Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.
2 This wounds me most (what can it less?
2 Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more.
2 So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.
2 But thou art serviceable to Heaven’s King!
2 Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?
2 For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.
2 By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.
2 But what have been thy answers?
2 And, not well understood, as good not known?
2 And run not sooner to his fatal snare?
2 Then to thyself ascrib’st the truth foretold.
2 At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.
2 To all truth requisite for men to know.
2 But misery, hath wrested from me.
2 Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?
2 Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.
2 Virtue who follow not her lore.
2 And talk at least, though I despair to attain.
2 Inspired: disdain not such access to me.
2 Permission from above; thou canst not more.
2 And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.
2 And, as the days increased, increased their doubt.
2 Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.
2 Or in Peraea—but returned in vain.
2 His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth.
2 Into perplexity and new amaze.
2 Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.
2 Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!
2 In public, and with him we have conversed.
2 Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return.
2 To find whom at the first they found unsought.
2 ‘Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!
2 With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.
2 Little suspicious to any king.
2 I looked for some great change.
2 My exaltation to afflictions high!
2 Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!
2 I will not argue that, nor will repine.
2 Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.
2 And sayings laid up, pretending strange events.
2 His end of being on Earth, and mission high.
2 Where all his Potentates in council sate.
2 Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.
2 And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.
2 Thought none my equal, now be overmatched.
2 Among daughters of men the fairest found.
2 Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.
2 As the magnetic hardest iron draws.
2 And made him bow, to the gods of his wives.
2 None are, thou think’st, but taken with such toys.
2 And coupled with them, and begot a race.
2 All her assaults, on worthier things intent!
2 In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.
2 Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.
2 At every sudden slighting quite abashed.
2 Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.
2 No advantage, and his strength as oft assay.
2 Though needing, what praise is it to endure?
2 Nature hath need of what she asks.
2 Me hungering more to do my Father’s will.
2 Of meats and drinks, nature’s refreshment sweet.
2 Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.
2 The Morn’s approach, and greet her with his song.
2 Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.
2 With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.
2 Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.
2 Forty and more deserted here indeed.
2 To whom thus Jesus:—“What conclud’st thou hence?
2 They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none.
2 “How hast thou hunger then?
2 “Hast thou not right to all created things?
2 Would scruple that, with want oppressed?
2 Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast.
2 Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!
2 Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.
2 From their soft wings, and Flora’s earliest smells.
2 “What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?
2 Hunger, with sweet restorative delight.
2 Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord.
2 What doubt’st thou, Son of God?
2 “Said’st thou not that to all things I had right?
2 And who withholds my power that right to use?
2 When and where likes me best, I can command?
2 In vain, where no acceptance it can find?
2 And with my hunger what hast thou to do?
2 And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles.
2 Why shouldst thou not accept it?
2 What I can do or offer is suspect.
2 Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil.
2 But wherewith to be achieved?
2 Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit.
2 Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost?
2 Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms.
2 Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends?
2 Not difficult, if thou hearken to me.
2 While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want.
2 That seat, and reign in Israel without end.
2 Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?
2 Riches, though offered from the hand of kings.
2 Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more?
2 Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.
2 That for the public all this weight he bears.
2 Or lawless passions in him, which he serves.
2 So reigning can be no sincere delight.
2 Far more magnanimous, than to assume.
2 To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed.
2 Contains of good, wise, just, the perfet shape.
2 In battle, though against thy few in arms.
2 These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide?
2 And dignities and powers, all but the highest?
2 Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe.
2 The Pontic king, and in triumph had rode.
2 Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment.
2 But thou yet art not too late.
2 For glory’s sake, by all thy argument.
2 The people’s praise, if always praise unmixed?
2 Things vulgar, and, well weighed, scarce worth the praise?
2 To live upon their tongues, and be their talk?
2 His lot who dares be singularly good.
2 Are few, and glory scarce of few is raised.
2 He asked thee, ‘Hast thou seen my servant Job?
2 To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame.
2 Worshipped with temple, priest, and sacrifice?
2 Violent or shameful death their due reward.
2 Who names not now with honour patient Job?
2 Poor Socrates, (who next more memorable?
2 Equal in fame to proudest conquerors.
2 And loses, though but verbal, his reward.
2 Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am.
2 Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption.
2 From us, his foes pronounced, glory he exacts.
2 Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy?
2 For so much good, so much beneficience!
2 That which to God alone of right belongs?
2 Them he himself to glory will advance.
2 Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass.
2 Easily from possession won with arms.
2 Thy right by sitting still, or thus retiring?
2 With Modin and her suburbs once content.
2 Thy country from her heathen servitude.
2 The happier reign the sooner it begins.
2 Rein then; what canst thou better do the while?
2 And time there is for all things, Truth hath said.
2 He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl.
2 My exaltation without change or end.
2 And my promotion will be thy destruction?
2 Of my reception into grace; what worse?
2 For where no hope is left is left no fear.
2 Of worse torments me than the feeling can.
2 The end I would attain, my final good.
2 Interposition, as a summer’s cloud.
2 Why move thy feet so slow to what is best?
